    <p>
      Crawl is a fun game in the grand tradition of similar games like Rogue,
      Hack and Moria. The objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave
      complex and retrieve the Orb of Zot, guarded by many horrible and hideous
      creatures.

      If you have never played Crawl (or a similar game) before, select the
      tutorial from the starting menu. The tutorial explains the interface in
      five easy lessons. Once you're familiar with the controls, you may want to
      play a few games using hints mode.

      This is the console (text) version, there is also a tiles version.
